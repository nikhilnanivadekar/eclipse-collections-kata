Eclipse Collections Kata 
===================
A [kata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata) is an exercise in martial arts. 
A [code kata](http://codekata.com/) is an exercise in programming which helps hone your skills through practice and repetition. 
The Eclipse Collections Kata is a fun way to help you learn idiomatic Eclipse Collections usage. 
This particular kata is set up as a series of unit tests which fail. 
Your task is to make them pass, using Eclipse Collections.

### Eclipse users

Initialize Eclipse project with the command below. 

##### Mac/Linux/Unix:
```

```
Once the project is initialized, 
you can import the project from "Import" => "General" => "Existing Projects into Workspace".
